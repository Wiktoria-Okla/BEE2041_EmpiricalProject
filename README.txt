## Introduction

This project uses web-scraped data of the Formula 1 2023 season to analyse race 
performance across different teams and individual drivers. The objective of this 
project is to analyse perfromance of teams and individual drivers to identify the 
strongest performers, the weakest, and those who show the most potential and should 
be watched out for in the 2024 season. The analysis also aims to investigate some key 
factors affecting race performance, such as performance in qualifying rounds, and pit 
stop times. The project also produces a linear regression model.

The project uses the BeautifulSoup package in Python to web-scrape data from the official
Formula 1 website: https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2023.html. The race results, qualifiers
results, and pit stop times are all scraped from individual sub-pages on the main Formula 1 
website.

Please note that the tables for the Emilia Romagna race have not been included in the analysis 
because this race was cancelled in the 2023 season.

It uses Python to clean and model the data by merging the necessary dataframes. It uses Python 
libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn to create graphical outputs and statistics out of the 
modelled dataframes.

When interepreting results please note that the points are only points scored in the final races
and do not include sprint races, hence there is a discrepancy between the final points in this
project and the official Formula 1 tables. 

Please note the last time the webscraping function was tested was on: 23/04/2024. There is a
possibility that the html addresses have been modified since.

## Repository overview
This repository is structured as follows:

├── data
    ├── F1_full_scraped.csv
    ├── F1_pit_scraped.csv
├── source
    ├── blog.ipynb
├── blog
├── code_output.pdf
└──README



The Jupyter notebook contained in the 'source code' folder contains all the code necessary to reproduce the project. This includes: Web-scraping data, cleaning data, modelling dataframes, producing outputs such as graphs and tables, and a regression model.

The clean dataframes produced in the Jupyter notebook are also saved as CSV copies in the 'data' folder. The F1_full_scraped.csv dataset corresponds to the race dataframe, and F1_pit_scraped.csv corresponds to pit stop dataframe.

The blog.txt file contains the links to the GitHub project repository and a link to the final blog post.

The file code_output.pdf contains the outputs of the Jupyter Notebook.


## Running instructions

In order to replicate all results the user needs to install python and run the 
code script contained in the blog.ipynb file.

This code has been tested using Python 3.8.8 Jupyter Notebook.
Within python, a number of additional libraries are required.  These are indicated below, along with
the version number used to generate original results:
 > beautifulsoup4 4.9.3
 > pandas 1.2.4
 > matplotlib 3.3.4
 > numpy 1.20.1
 > seaborn 0.11.1
 > statsmodels 0.12.2
