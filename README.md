## Introduction

This project uses web-scraped data of the Formula 1 2023 season to analyse race 
performance across different teams and individual drivers. The objective of this 
project is to analyse perfromance of teams and individual drivers to identify the 
strongest performers, the weakest, and those who show the most potential and should 
be watched out for in the 2024 season. The analysis also aims to investigate some key 
factors affecting race performance, such as performance in qualifying rounds, and pit 
stop times. The project also produces a linear regression model.

The project uses the BeautifulSoup package in Python to web-scrape data from the official
Formula 1 website: https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2023.html. The race results, qualifiers
results, and pit stop times are all scraped from individual sub-pages on the main Formula 1 
website.

Please note that the tables for the Emilia Romagna race have not been included in the analysis 
because this race was cancelled in the 2023 season.

It uses Python to clean and model the data by merging the necessary dataframes. It uses Python 
libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn to create graphical outputs and statistics out of the 
modelled dataframes.

When interepreting results please note that the points are only points scored in the final races
and do not include sprint races, hence there is a discrepancy between the final points in this
project and the official Formula 1 tables.

All data is contained in the Jupter notebook, and all output is automatically 
turned into graphical output.


## Running instructions

In order to replicate all results the user needs to install python and run the 
code script contained in the blog.ipynb file.

This code has been tested using Python 3.8.8 Jupyter Notebook.
Within python, a number of additional libraries are required.  These are indicated below, along with
the version number used to generate original results:
 > beautifulsoup4 4.9.3
 > pandas 1.2.4
 > matplotlib 3.3.4
 > numpy 1.20.1
 > seaborn 0.11.1
 > statsmodels 0.12.2
